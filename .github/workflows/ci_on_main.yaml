    # We would like to run this workflow for all commits in the target branch.
    # But we need to limit the workflow concurrency to ensure a deployment order as FIFO.
    #
    # If we use `${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}` and the invoked workflow for our `ci` job also has same group id,
    # this workflow will be cancelled by the invoked workflow's `concurrency` setting.
    # To avoid this problem, we use uuid v4 as a key to mark this workflow's uniqueness.
